# DRBD 8.4

This repository contains the Linux kernel code for DRBD 8.4.

DRBD, developed by [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com), is a software that allows RAID 1 functionality over
TCP/IP for GNU/Linux. DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability clusters and
software defined storage by providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in nodes synchronised using
TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoids the use of uncommon hardware (shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel).

# Using DRBD
