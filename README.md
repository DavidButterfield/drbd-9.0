# DRBD

DRBD, developed by [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com), provides networked RAID 1 functionality for GNU/Linux.
It is designed for high availability clusters and software defined storage.
DRBD keeps disks on multiple nodes synchronized using TCP/IP or RDMA and makes the data available as a block device.
This results in RAID 1 but without the use of uncommon hardware such as shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel.

This repository contains the Linux kernel code for DRBD version 9 and above.

# Using DRBD

# Support
For further products and professional support, please
[contact](http://links.linbit.com/support) us.

# Contributing
Development is coordinated via [mailing lists](http://lists.linbit.com). Currently, we do not intend to use
github issue tracking/github PRs.

# Releases
Releases generated by git tags on github are snapshots of the git repository at the given time. You most
likely do not want to use these. They might lack things such as generated man pages, the `configure` script,
and other generated files. If you want to build from a tarball, use the ones [provided by us](https://www.linbit.com/en/drbd-community/drbd-download/).
